# Monorepo architecture with react and lerna

This project provides a bootstrap setup to implement monorepo architecture.
It uses multiple react projects.
- Main parent project (main-app) - uses common components from child apps
- Child project (child-app-1)

Lerna is used to configure monorepo structure

To know how to setup - take a look at [monorepo.setup.md](https://github.com/jithinolickal/monorepo-architecture-react-lerna/blob/master/monorepo.setup.md)
